## @Mentions in Chat
Allow coordinators to be @mentioned in flow chat. Only show @mentioned messages in Attention Needed (as opt-in alternative to all-messages default).

**Current behavior:** All unread assignee messages on runs you're involved in show as "Attention Needed."
**Proposed:** Add @mention support. When enabled, only @mentioned messages appear in Attention Needed, reducing noise for coordinators on high-volume flows.
