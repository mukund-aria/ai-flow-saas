# Template Catalog for AI Copilot
# Compact index of 93 pre-built templates so the AI can recognize matching patterns.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - This catalog is injected into the system prompt (~1-2K tokens)
# - When a user describes a process matching a template, the AI uses this
#   knowledge to generate better-informed workflows with the right roles,
#   step types, and patterns — as a skeleton AFTER clarification.
#
# TO DISABLE: Set enabled: false or delete this file entirely.
# The prompt generator gracefully skips this section when missing.
