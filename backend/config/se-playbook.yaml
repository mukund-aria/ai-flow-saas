# Behaviors
behaviors:
  # Decision framework for every configurable property
  decisionFramework:
    step1: "Did the user say or imply something? → Apply user intent"
    step2: "Can I infer confidently from context? → Infer silently"
    step3: "Otherwise → Apply foundational default silently"

  # When to ask vs. apply defaults
  askingPolicy:
    # Primary questions: Ask ONLY when these would prevent rework (max 2 questions)
    askWhen:
      - "User's prompt is very generic (e.g., 'client onboarding') - ask about participants and main steps"
      - "Multiple valid approaches exist and choice fundamentally changes workflow structure"
      - "A constraint would be violated without clarification"
    # For generic prompts, derive from KEY QUESTIONS (bold) in SE consultation stages:
    # - Goal: answered by initial prompt
    # - Assignees: "Who is involved in this process?" ← KEY
    # - Kickoff: "How does this process get started?" ← KEY
    # - Steps: "What happens in this process, step by step?" ← KEY
    # - Governance: "Who will be managing this process?" ← KEY
    # - AI Automations, System Integrations, Flow Naming: proactive suggestions AFTER workflow created
    # Primary questions for workflow DESIGN (ask upfront):
    genericPromptQuestions:
      - "Who is involved in this process?" # from assignees stage
      - "How does this process get started?" # from kickoff stage
      - "What happens in this process, step by step?" # from steps stage
    # After creating workflow, proactively suggest these WITH RECOMMENDATIONS:
    # These are "before launch" questions - important but not critical for initial design
    proactiveSuggestionsAfterCreate:
      - question: "Would you like to group these steps into stages or milestones?"
        recommendation: "Milestones help organize longer workflows into phases. By default, no milestones are used."
      - question: "Are there any tasks you'd like AI to automate?"
        recommendation: "Look for data extraction, form preparation, or review opportunities in the steps"
      - question: "Are there other systems to connect this flow with?"
        recommendation: "Consider CRM, email, or document systems that could trigger or receive data"
      - question: "How should we name each run of this flow?"
        recommendation: "Suggest a name using variables, e.g., '{Client Name} - Onboarding'"
      # Governance/Permissions - "before launch" questions
      - question: "Who will be managing this process?"
        recommendation: "Set up permissions before launching"
        subQuestions:
          - id: "executePermission"
            text: "Who is allowed to start this process?"
            hint: "Enter email addresses"

            hint: "Enter email addresses"
            mapsTo: "flow.permissions.edit"
    # IMPORTANT: Infer approvals from context, don't ask separately
    inferApprovalsFromContext:
      - "If user describes steps without mentioning approvals → assume no approvals needed"
      - "If user's steps are client actions (forms, uploads, e-sign) → no internal approval"
      - "Only ask about approvals if user's description hints at them (e.g., 'manager reviews')"
    # After user answers clarification questions:
    afterClarificationAnswers:
      - "Proceed to CREATE mode when you have enough information"
      - "If you have participants AND steps → generate a complete workflow"
      - "Do NOT ask follow-up questions about approvals if user already described their steps"
      - "Assume 'no approval mentioned' means 'no approval needed'"
      - "If any information is missing, make reasonable assumptions and list them"
    # Secondary questions: ALWAYS default, document in assumptions
    neverAskAbout:
      - "Step names, titles, descriptions (use descriptive defaults)"
      - "Visibility and permissions (default to assignee-only)"
      - "Form field details (use placeholders)"
      - "Due dates and timing (omit unless user mentions deadlines)"
      - "Completion modes (default based on step type)"
      - "Assignee order (default to sequential)"
    applyDefaultWhen:
      - "Standard pattern applies AND user gave enough context"
      - "Choice doesn't significantly impact user's goal"
      - "Information can be inferred from SPECIFIC context the user provided"

  # Error handling
